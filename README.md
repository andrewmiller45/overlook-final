### Setting Up: 
* On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button to fork this repo.
* Clone down the forked repo by clicking the green **Code** button, and then copying the link under **SSH**.
* In your terminal, type in `git clone` and then paste the copied link.
* Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies, by running `npm install`.
* Run `npm start` in the terminal, and copy the URL link (`http://localhost:8080/`) to see the HTML page 
* Clone the API as well, located here: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api
* To stop running the server, use Control + C in the terminal. (Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.)
* And now you're ready to get cookin'!

### How To Use: <a name="how"></a>

* On page load, you will be prompted to login. You can login with the username: customer50 (any number between 1-50 will work).  The password is overlook2021.  
* Once on the home screen, you will see a list of the user's current bookings, their name, and their total spend at Del Rio's Regal Motel.
* You can select a date and room type for booking, and it will filter out the available rooms to the user interacting with the page.  Feel free to play around toggling back and forth between bookings and available rooms to see it update.

### Challenges: <a name="challenges"></a> <br>

I had the most difficulty navigating the POST/FETCH requests and making sure that my data going out and in was consistent with the local server.  There was a lot of console logging needed to properly get that functionality working.

<br>

### Reflections: <a name="reflections"></a> <br>

* I am feeling solid with my iteration methods and using them to manipulate to the DOM.  The data in this project was much easier to work with than the data in our previous group project, which made learning goals much easier to attain.  I am happy that the class to class interaction feels like a very easy concept compared to where I was in Mod1.  Overall feeling very happy and excited to move into deeper knowledge of my CSS skills/React/etc. moving forward.

<br>

### Future Iterations: <a name="future"></a> <br>

* Clean up the CSS.  CSS is easily the weakest aspect of my dev skills.

* Adding additional filter functionality.

* Allow users to create their own usernames and passwords.
 
* Build out the manager class to begin learning about DELETE requests with APIs.
